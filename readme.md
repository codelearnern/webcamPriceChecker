So I wanna get the Logitech C920 webcam because
my existing webcam isn't that great and I 
want a good webcam for my YouTube videos(if you wanna see
my channel, [click this](https://youtube.com/c/JustProgram).
But I wanna get notified when it's under a certain
price, this is why I wrote a Python program to do it for me :)

I'm too lazy to ask Amazon permission to use their API
and all that jazz, so I just used Selenium(and am trying
to make a version that uses BeautifulSoup).

Also, if anybody knows a free Python module or an API
that lets me send text messages for free, 
please tell me :D  Right now, it notifies using the Gmail API.
The SendGmail folder is a program that handles sending emails,
if you wanna see that project on Github,

(This is a work in progress)
